# Startaste
Another OS! This was made simply as a side project, don't expect it to be great.

------
## Install
To install Startaste download the source package via git or zip. `git clone https://github.com/DragonMastur/Startaste.git` to pull via git, or download link https://github.com/DragonMastur/Startaste.git. Then in a terminal make it using `make run`. If you don't want the os to run (i.e. development) use `make all` instead. If your wanting to run a different bootloader simply add a `file` variable in the command line, `make all file=[filename]`.
